Change:   The job server information is now displayed left-justified.
Change:   Documents can now be automatically copied when a document is promoted within a lifecycle.

Version 1.85
Added:    If the user is an administrator, a button to use the Update Manager, has been added to the version warning screen.
Added:    Administrators can now set the number of documents displayed in the document history block.
Added:    The document's path, in the DMS, is now displayed on the options screen.

Change:   In any list box containing user names, the group drop-down box has been eliminated and all user names are now displayed.
Change:   Certain configurations are now locked after the first document has been stored in the system.  This is done to help preserve the integrity
          of the document repository by making it difficult to change document repository and operating system configurations.
Change:   With the exception of document creation and importation, DMS now works in PHP 5.x.  This will be fixed in version 1.86.
Change:   The "\" is now accepted in the repository path.

Added:    Jobs can now have a user-defined name.
Added:    Job to publish a text file that provides the name and object id's of the newest 10 documents that are in a defined folder.
Added:    Documents can be accessed externally, without logging into Xoops, if they have everyone permissions set to Read-Only or greater.  This is 
          accomplished by calling the following PHP script:  file_retrieve_extern.php?obj_id=<obj_id>  This feature has been added in order to provide
          loose integration between the DMS module and other systems.  Due to security concerns, this feature must be enabled in the configuration.
Added:    Capability to specify the folder to open from the URL on the main screen.  This is accomplished by calling:  index.php?folder_id=<obj_id>
Change:   Minor UI Improvements to Job Server Manager.
Change:   Fixed a bug in the file_import.php file that resulted in the entire path being used in the document name.  This occurred when the user 
          didn't give the document a name on a Windows PC.
Change:   Removed some debugging code from the MMS Integration.
	  
Version 1.83
Added:    PHP-based Job Server with the ability to set the full text search indexing and to set the permissions on objects to those of a permissions
          group.  The ability to purge deleted objects will be added at a later date.  The job server needs to be scheduled to run on a regular basis,
          preferably every 15 minutes, by using scheduling a command such as "php -f /var/www/xoops/modules/dms/job_server.php".
Change:   When importing a document, the filename of the document is automatically displayed in the "Name" field, if a name is not entered.
Change:   Fixed a bug in the query function that resulted in a MySQL warning when other than a SELECT query was issued.
Change:   Fixed a bug that can result in the everyone permissions not being changed when a permissions group is utilized.

Added:    After a document is routed, the audit log detail screen now displays the inbox(es) where the document has been routed to.
Change:   Deleted documents are removed from the Document History block.
Change:   Documents with apostrophe's in the file name now have the apostrophe removed.  This fixes SQL errors created by the
          existance of the apostrophe.
Change:   When documents are copied, the properties are copied as well
Change:   Misc. minor bug fixes.

Version 1.80

Added:     Alphabetical Sorting to the Single Directory Beta User Interface.
Change:    Fixed bugs in paging system in Single Directory Beta User Interface.
Change:    Misc., minor bug fixes.

Version 1.70

Added:     Capability to move document links (routed documents) to other folders.
Added:     Groups of permissions can be created.  These groups can be used with the lifecycle system and can be configured only to change a sub-set of
           permissions.  For example, it is possible to only change the group permissions when promoting a document to another stage in a lifecycle.
Added:     When applying a lifecycle, a copy of the document can be left in the original folder.
Added:     Beta releases of two greatly optimized user interfaces.  Optimization has been accomplished via the use of SQL query optimization.
Added:     The "Propagate Permissions" administrative button can be disabled globally via the configuration screen.
Added:     Administrators can set folders to provide an archive option to move the contents of a folder to an archive location.

Added:     Documents can now be copied to a file system, if a file system directory is added in the DMS.
Added:     2 database indexes to improve performance.
Added:     A confirmation message has been added when importing documents.
Change:    Fixed a bug that prevented the import from file system feature from working properly. 
Change:    When creating a document, from a template, the name of the document is now entered after selecting the template.
Change:    Re-enabled security on file_retrieve.php.
Change:    All users are now displayed in the "users" section, when changing permissions.

Version 1.60
Added:     By selecting the "Search Current Document Versions Only" check box, from the configurations screen, Swish-E will only index the current 
           version of each document.  This setting should be set upon the initial configuration, of the DMS module, and should not be changed.
Added:     Online help system.
Added:     Uploads larger than allowed by the php.ini file now terminate with an error.
Added:     Documents can now be searched by the document owner permission and time created.
Added:     Properties searches can now be limited to folders and sub-folders.
Change:    Fixed a bug, in the file_checkin.php file, to prevent 0 byte uploads.
Change:    Misc. minor interface fixes.
   
Version 1.50
Added:     The configuration screen now has the option to enable or disable the displaying of the template and/or lifecycle with the document name.
Added:     If configured, the document's version number can be added directly to a Word document, similar to the ADN System.  This system is called
           the ADV System.
Added:     It is now possible to revert to an older version of a document.  If the versioning system is enabled, a "Revert" function is available in
           the Options menu.
Added:     The folder move function is now confirmed via a pop-up window.
Added:     The ADN System is now executed when checking in a document.
Added:     When a document has been promoted to the final stage, all previous versions of that document are automatically deleted to save space.  This
           feature has to be enabled.  In the future, this deletion will be as per lifecycle, not global.
Added:     Lifecycle stages are now displayed in search results....if enabled.
Added:     When checking-in a document from the main screen, a pop-up box is displayed afterwards indicating successful checkin.
Added:     Document History block.  Up to the last 10 documents that have been viewed are displayed.  Clicking on the document name opens up the Options
           Screen for the document.
Added:     Custom create/view/edit pages for in-house use only.
Added:     When in a lifecycle, a document can automatically be placed in an alphabetical sub-directory.  This option has to be enabled.
Added:     If applicable, the lifecycle name and lifecycle stage is now displayed on the file_options screen.
Change:    The configuration screen can now be reached from the Site Admin screen.
Change:    Icons have replaced the text at the top right of the main screen.
Change:    If while creating a document with a template, the document name is not entered, the template's document name will be used.
Change:    After a document's properties or comments have been updated, a confirmation is displayed.
Change:    After a document is created, the check-in version defaults to version 1.0.
Change:    The buttons to the Apply Lifecycle screen are left-justified.
Change:    When demoting a document, the document can now be demoted to any previous stage.
Change:    If configured, the last lifecycle stage name will remain on a document that has reached the end of it's lifecycle.
Change:    When applying a lifecycle, promoting, or demoting a document, the user returns to the options screen of the document.
Change:    Fixed a bug, in the folder_options.php screen, that prevented the folder type from being properly displayed. (reported by camauz)
Change:    The ADN and ADV systems will not make changes when a document is in the document templates folder.
Change:    The ADN and ADV systems now work with MS-Excel documents.  A bug has been fixed that prevented the end of document files from being scanned
           for the masks.
Change:    The main query for displaying folders is now located in inc_dms_functions.php.
Change:    Updated the readme.txt file.
Change:    Changed the text options, on the main user interfaces, to icons.
Change:    Misc. minor bug fixes.

Version 1.40
Added:     Status display screen displays the number of documents and folders in the DMS.  More information may be added to this screen in the future.
Added:     On the initial install, the main screen configuration button takes the user to a special configuration screen that only contains the 
           configuration for the document repository as this is the only configuration that is required to use the DMS.
Added:     If enabled, in-boxes for routed documents are now created automatically.
Added:     Folders can now be moved to other parent folders by the owner of the folder.
Added:     Buttons, on the file_options.php and folder_options pages, that take the user directly to parts of the page without scrolling.
Added:     Some actions are now confirmed via a pop-up window.  This window automatically disappears after 3.5 seconds and (in Firefox) will remain
           in the same location if the page is scrolled.
Change:    Routing, Lifecycles, Comments, Checkin/out are now disabled, by default, on installation.  They can be enabled on the 
           configuration screen.  Since versioning is controlled by checkin/checkout, the "View older version" function is disabled if checkin/checkout
           is disabled.
Change:    Bug fixed that resulted in truncated filenames when downloading documents, if there was a space in the filename.  
           (Fix contributed by mwoodman.)
Change:    Bug fixed that resulted in the Anonymous user name being displayed when unsuccessfully routing documents.
Change:    The templates folder is no longer automatically created and specified upon installation.  In order to use document templates, a folder for
           the document templates must be created, templates uploaded, and the templates folder set in the configuration.
Change:    Removed all Xoops-specific functions from file_route.php.
Change:    If the DMS Page Title field is blank, no header is displayed.
Change:    Misc. minor bug fixes.
Change:    Bug fix to the ADN system.
Change:    When importing files, if the "Name" field is left blank, the document's filename is used.
Change:    Bug fix:  After changing document permissions, the permissions section of the web page is displayed.
Change:    The notification system is now called the "folder subscription system."  The folder subscription system now works with all document functions,
           if enabled. 
Change:    Bug fix when setting the source of the groups in inc_dms_functions.php.

Version 1.31
Added:     Automatic document numbering for MS Word documents.  If configured, DMS can automatically add the document number to a property of a MS Word 
           document. 

Version 1.30
Added:     Tabstops for various input fields and forms.
Added:     Document titles can be searched via the Xoops search block.
Change:    Fixed a bug that prevented the drop-down menus from working.
Change:    Fixed a bug in the subscriptions system that prevented documents from being checked-out.
Change:    Eliminated "browser flash" between web pages.  (Process contributed by mwoodman.) (Works best with Firefox.)
Change:    Fixed bug that resulted in "file_view.php" does not exist error when an anonymous user does a properties search.
Change:    DMS can now be made the default module if an anonymous user is not configured.  If the DMS module is to be displayed, without
           a user logging in, an anonymous user will have to be set.
Change:    Fixed a bug that resulted in folders not being created if they contain an apostrophe.
Change:    Fixed mysql sql errors that resulted in problems installing on a Windows system.  

Version 1.20
Added:     A notification system has been added to allow the owner of a folder to configure the folder such that the a select list of groups and/or
           users are e-mailed about changes in the folder.
Change:    The Permissions system has been slightly adjusted to conform to the permissions system matrix.
Change:    Forced the configuration screen to be left-justified regardless of the style sheets.
Change:    Added an exit button to the configuration screen.
Change:    Force the lifecycle stage names to be left-justified.
Change:    Fixed a bug that prevented sub-folders from being displayed when selecting the template to use to create a document.

Version 1.10
Added:     The capability to force a permissions update has been added.  Users can now click on the "Refresh" link on the main page in order to clear
           the permissions cache.  This will only appear if the permissions caching system is enabled.
Added:     Users can now add comments to a version of a document.  If subscriptions are enabled and a user is subscribed, the comment will be added
           to the e-mail.
Added:     The default user interface can now be changed from the configuration screen.
Added:     Administrators can now set permissions inheritance from the configuration screen.
Added:     Permissions caching is now disabled by default and can be enabled on the configuration screen.  Enabling the permissions caching system will
           provide a performance improvement on larger DMS installations.
Added:     Administrators can now add and remove users from groups using an interface within DMS.
Change:    With the exception of the Update Manager, all configuration is now accomplished through the Admin menu on the main menu.
Change:    Users now require owner permission to change the permissions on a document or folder.
Change:    Updated user interface, on the auditing screens, to the current standard.
Change:    Moved all group handling functions to the portal abstraction layer.

Version 1.00
Added:     A "Portal Abstraction Layer" has been added, as a header file.  In the future, this will allow developers
           to easily separate the DMS module from Xoops and utilize it elsewhere.  At this time, only the database calls
           are directed here.  The Xoops specific function calls are still spread throughout the DMS module.
Added:     Documents with an applied lifecycle now display the name of the lifecycle stage in parentheses after the 
           document name, on the main screen.
Added:     Documents, that have been created with a template, now have the template name displayed in parentheses, on
           the main screen.
Added:     If inherit_perms is set to 1, in the dms_config table, then when a document is imported or created the permissions are
           inherited from the parent folder.
To-Do:     E-mails now have a timestamp at the bottom.
Change:    By setting the Document Storage Tuning value to 0, in the Document Repository configuration, all files will
           be saved in a single directory as indicated in the Document Storage Path.  Setting this value to 0 is only
           recommended for users who are having a problem uploading documents to the document repository and do not 
           anticipate more than several thousand documents ever being uploaded into the system.
Change:    When creating a document, the document name is now entered when selecting the template.  Also, the file name,
           of the document, is created automatically by utilizing the document name.
Change:    When creating lifecycles, the page is now reloaded when updating the lifecycle stage number, lifecycle stage
           name, and lifecycle folder.  This should fix a bug that sometimes resulted in the lifecycle stage permissions
           not being properly set.
Change:    Miscellaneous bug fixes.
Removed:   Unused files have been removed.

Version 0.99
  Added:   A default_interface row has been added to the dms_config table in preparation for other primary interfaces.
  Added:   A subscriptions system has been added.  This allows users to "subscribe" to a document.  Once subscribed,
           they will receive e-mails when a document has been checked-in or checked-out.
  Added:   French language files have been added.  (Translation by Eric Wegrznowski.)
  Added:   If more than a set number of documents is in a folder, the folder will only display that number of documents
           and the remainder of the documents can be displayed by paging through the folder via the arrows that will
           be displayed at the bottom of the folder.  This number is set by the doc_display_limit entry in the 
           dms_config table.  This was added in order to prevent a folder with thousands of documents from excessively
           loading down the web server.
  Added:   If the number of documents, displayed in a folder, exceeds the number set by the doc_display_limit entry in 
           the dms_config table, a "Sort By" option is displayed that allows you to sort by the first letter of the
           document name of a document.
  Added:   By setting the default_interface setting, in the dms_config table, to '2', the main interface will only 
           display the active folder and it's parent folder.  This interface was added to optimize large document
           repositories by only displaying the active folder and avoiding SQL queries that are used only to display
           the folder structure.  In our production environment, with over 90,000 documents, the time to display a web
           page was reduced from 15 to under 5 seconds.  Eventually, administrators will be able to change the interface
           from a web page.
  Added:   Disk directories can now be displayed in a web browser.  This allows the importation of documents from any
           location, including documents that have been scanned and deposited in a directory.
  Added:   A new table has been created to store any miscellaneous object data.  This table is named dms_object_misc.
  Added:   Permanent folder deletion has been added for empty folders only.  Folders with child objects will only
           be marked as deleted.
  Added:   When a lifecycle is applied to a document, the document's permissions can be set to change as per the
           permissions set in that stage of the lifecycle.
  Change:  Permanent document deletion is now enabled when the DMS is installed.
  Change:  Options menu on document, folder, and routed document options screens has been replaced by a DHTML menu.
  Change:  The permissions caching system's configuration is no longer hard-coded.  It is now in the dms_config table.
  Change:  index.php now includes inc_main_ui_1.php in preparation for the creation of the Version 2.0 interface.  Most
           of the code formerly in index.php is now located in inc_main_ui_1.php.
  Change:  Jpeg file types now supported by the migration compatibility code.
  Change:  Apache/IE/SSL download fix applied.
  Change:  Fixed a bug that prevented documents from being created from templates.
  Change:  Bzip2 compressed files can now be used to update DMS when uploaded from Konquer.
  Change:  Deleted folders no longer are displayed when selecting a folder in the lifecycle_stage_editor.php.
  Change:  Icons have been changed to Crystal Icons.  Mark Rabideau submitted free crystal icons to replace the old
           icons.  The old icons are still available in the images/orig directory, however.  
  Change:  The status column has been removed.  Checked-out documents now have a lock displayed on their icon.
  Change:  A folder for Document Templates is now added automatically during the installation of the DMS.  
  Change:  Since a third folder type has been added, folder types can now be changed by administrators on the folder
           options page via a drop-down box.  If a folder is going to be pointed at a directory on the filesystem,
           the directory will have to be added in the space provided.
  Change:  Minor user interface changes.
  Change:  Change to swish-e code to allow full text search to work if swish-e returns a blank within the quotes.
  
Version 0.98
  Added:   New versions of the DMS can now be uploaded into the DMS and installed by the DMS Update Manager.
           Note:  This feature is currently not supported on Windows Servers.  It may function, however, if Windows 
           ports of tar, bunzip2, and/or unzip are installed on the Windows Server and a path is added to these
           utilities.
  Added:   The dms_config table now contains a timestamp to record the time of the last config change.
  Added:   Other languages can now be supported.  (Changes provided by Rui Gonca.)
  Added:   Portugues.do.brasil is now supported.  (Translation by Rui Gonca.)
  Added:   A web page has been added for administrators to select the Root Folder for Template Documents.  The object ID
           can still be manually entered.
  Added:   Documents can now be exported from the DMS by using the Export button on the Options page for the document or
           routed document.
  Added:   Recipients of routed documents can now receive an e-mail informing them of a routed document.
  Added:   Documents stored in the DMS can now be e-mailed from the DMS if the sender has at least read-only permissions.
  Added:   Documents can now be permanently deleted.  This deletion can either happen immediately or after a delay that
           is set by the administrator.  Folders can not be permanently deleted at this time.
  Added:   When configuring Full Text Search, there is now a button to write the Swish-E configuration files to the
           repository directory.  This button will only appear if the repository is configured.  However, Swish-E still
           has to be executed from the operating system shell or from a sheduled job in order to index the documents.
  Change:  The configuration is now cached in a session variable.  The first time the DMS is executed, a session variable
           to store the configuration is created.  Afterwards, only the timestamp is queried from the configuration and 
           the configuration is only updated if this timestamp changes.  Otherwise, the cached configuration is used.  
           This will help reduce the data transfered in SQL queries from the web server to the database server.
  Change:  Fixed a bug that prevented a document from being copied to another folder.
